I"’<p>â€œWhy do you think Shuda sensei is so popular?â€ I once asked this journalâ€™s director, Mr. Mizutani. â€œItâ€™s his personality,â€ he said. Though his eyes are small, Mr. Mizutaniâ€™s insight about people is a reliable one. He also said, â€œShuda Sensei seems very re- laxed, so much so that he may look even lazy, but actually he is a very studious stu- dent. He just doesnâ€™t show it.â€</p>
