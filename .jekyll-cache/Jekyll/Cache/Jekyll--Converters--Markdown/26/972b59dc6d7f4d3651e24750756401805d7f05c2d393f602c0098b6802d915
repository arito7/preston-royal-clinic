I",<p>For nearly ten years I had worked in a restaurant. Every single day I would cut vegetables, peel shrimps, and make tempura. It wasnâ€™t fun. The restaurant I worked at has become very successful but when I started working, the owners were working day and night, and did everything themselves.</p>
