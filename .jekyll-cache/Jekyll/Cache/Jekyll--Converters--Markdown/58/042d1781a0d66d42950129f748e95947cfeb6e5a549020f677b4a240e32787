I"1<p>This past September 8-10, I attended the Extraordinary Vessel Treatment seminar taught by Miyawaki Sensei in Santa Fe, New Mexico. A three-day seminar is hard on an aged body, but considering the fact that Miyawaki Sensei, who looks my age, is in fact, one cycle (12 years) older than me, I cannot complain.<!--more--> I bought <em>EV Treatment Made Easy</em> by Kazuto Miyawaki about 15 years ago, tried it for awhile, and eventually gave it up because I didn’t quite get it. I looked forward to this rare opportunity to join a workshop taught by the author himself.</p>

<p>Koei Kuwahara Sensei, a long-time friend of Miyawaki Sensei, was in attendance as a facilitator. Miyawaki Sensei’s wife Kaori-san was an assistant, and needless to say, Stephen Brown was an interpreter. Just by looking at these members one would expect a great workshop! Miyawaki Sensei started off introducing himself in English, which greatly impressed Mr. Brown. According to Mr. Brown who interprets for so many well-known Japanese acupuncturists, it is rare that a master not used to speaking English dares to do so in front of students. They usually don’t put themselves in a vulnerable position like that. Miyawaki Sensei, however, wished to put himself close to students and also to relax them. Mr. Brown said he felt love and humility from Miyawaki Sensei. Totally agreeing with him, I was impressed by Mr. Brown who is so perceptive of people.</p>

<p>Kuwahara Sensei is very popular among all the students and known for his Taoist-like teaching style. His Qigong exercise before each class was a big plus. In both Meridian Therapy and EV therapy, pulse diagnosis and abdominal diagnosis are really essential, and in fact the success of the treatment depends on fingertip sensitivity. Qigong is one of the best ways to develop that fingertip sensitivity according to Kuwahara Sensei . At one point, before the exercise he said, “There is a good reason fordoingQigongexercise in this workshop. We are not doing this just to kill time.” As healers, we should stay healthy and keep maintain good Qi flow. I noticed that both Miyawaki Sensei and Kuwahara Sensei were always smiling. They must have a good Qi flow and that fact already put them in a master class. Personally, “Laughing Qigong” was one of the best Qigongs and a good example of “We don’t laugh because we are having fun, but we are having fun because we laugh.”</p>

<p>Let’s get back on track. At first, there was a lecture on Meridian Therapy by Kuwahara Sensei, because Meridian Therapy and EVTherapy are inseparable. One could say the former is root treatment and the latter is symptomatic treatment. There are not many points to use in EV Treatment: Sl-3, BL- 62, TW-5, GB-41, LU-7, KD-6, PC-6, SP-4, and as supplemental points: LR-3, HT-s, Ll-4, ST-43. We choose two points and use them as a pair. How to choose the specific pair is depends on: the flow of channels, symptomology and pathology, palpation with pressure, extraordinary vessel abdominal diagnosis, pulse taking, the use of tester magnets, and comprehensive diagnosis. Among these methods, EVabdominaldiagnosis is largely developed by Miyawaki Sensei and it is said that this made EV treatment much easier to use.</p>

<p>Watching is one thing and doing is completely another. Masters make it look so easy that one tends to think, “Oh, it’s a piece of cake.” But in reality it’s not so. Just determining which channel is most involved is not that simple, nor is symptomology and pathology. Even in EV abdominal diagnosis it is hard to come up with the right decision. It is funny to think that one could do right away what a master took a long time to develop.</p>

<p>On the third day, one of the students was chosen to demonstrate in front of all the others. The lucky one was Ehrland Truitt who organized this workshop in Santa Fe. We all felt his tension as he began his treatment. Miyawaki Sensei told him that he could start with either Meridian or EV treatment. Ehrland started with Meridian Treatment on a young male patient with tight abdominal muscles and came up with Liver Kyo-sho. Then Miyawaki Sensei diagnosed, said nothing, just smiled, and told Ehrland to continue. He did Ho (tonification) on KD-10 and LV-8. The patient later on told me that at that point he felt a good effect on his body, but the tightness in the shoulders and discomfort in the upper abdomen and very chronic left-eye strain were still there. Miyawaki Sensei then sug- gested treatingthis as Spleen Kyo. When HC-7 and SP-3 were tonified, the patient immediately felt a release of his shoulder tightness. The EV pattern was LR-3 and HT-7 (instead of HT-5). After the EV treatment, his shoulders, upper abdomen, and even left-eye strain felt better, he said afterward. As far as I know, these points of complaint were untouched except when checking.</p>

<p>After the treatment, Miyawaki Sensei commented: “That was a tough case to discern the right sho. I would have missed it myself too, had I not seen so many just like him (the patient). Ehrland-san did a wonderful job. “They shook hands and everyone gave them a big round of applause. Still holding Sensei’s hand, Ehrland made a very deep bow. At 5’2” Miyawaki Sensei looked bigger than the 6’ 2” Ehrland. Looking at them, I felt Ehrland’s sincerity toward this medicine that was both inspiring and moving. I understood why Ehrland was chosen.</p>

<p>Miyawaki Sensei was so considerate in his efforts to make the lecture more fun. So much so that he made many puns to make us laugh. Unfortunately, they were all in ]apanese and I could see Mr. Brown having a hard time every once in a while. To make matters worse, Miyawaki Sensei spoke with an Osaka dialect, which was even tougher for him to translate. I asked Mr. Brown a question that had been on my mind for awhile and since he interprets countless well-known japanese acupuncturists he seemed to be the right one to answer.</p>

<p>“Do you really think it makes that much of a difference just missing the exact point by a few millimeters, or changing the position only slightly? It seems incredibly subtle.”</p>

<p>“Well, I noticed with Shudo Sensei as well, that senseis at that level seem to be able to cure with their Qi anyway. So, it’s difficult to tell what is really working.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought so. Masters can use any technique and make it work.”</p>

<p>“Right. But as Tora-san said, “That makes the end of the story. (There is nothing more to be said.)” If you admit this then we would be criticized, “That’s why Japanese acupuncture is so vague and not logical.”</p>

<p>I thought it funny to hear Tora-san’s famous phrase from Mr. Brown, but my mind was already busy figuring out how to be at that level without being a uchideshi (devoted disciple) or taking workshops.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Tora-san is a very famous movie character known for being likeable and irresponsible.</em></p>
