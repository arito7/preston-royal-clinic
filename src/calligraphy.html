          Ultimate question: What is God? It is said that only God is real. Enlightened people invariably says, “Only
          love
          is real.” Then, God must be Love.

          Japanese pronouciation: “moh-ko-ri-ta” I believe this motto is Shudo Denmei sensei’s favorite. He says that
          often
          he gives the best treatment when he is completely immmersed in the treatment. I believe we do the best work
          when
          we forget about ourselves and just think for someone else. That is often when we are totally present. In other
          words, we shine the most when we are egoless.

          I think that “growing up” means to appreciate daily life, or to be able to appreciate every moment of daily
          life.
          How precious that is! I can see. I can hear. I can walk. I can eat. I can drive. I can talk. I can eat with my
          children. I can laugh with them. Oh, how joyous that moment is! Nothing cannot be taken for granted. Every
          step I
          take is not the same step I have taken before. Everyday is filled with special “same old same old”, and I am
          tested every moment if I am appreciating that special “same old “.

          Literally this means “to illuminate one corner.” It is a quote by Saicho, famous Japanese Buddhist monk in 8th
          century. To illuminate the corner where you are is another way of saying “do the best wherever you are”, which
          is
          actually all you can do anyway. By doing the very best where you are, if everyone does the same, the whole
          world
          would become a better place. My translation is simply “Shine where you are”, and I believe you get the sense.

          This is a basic philosophy of Confucianism. In order to have a world peace, each country must be ruled by good
          order. In order for that, each household should have good harmony inside. In order for that, each one must
          control
          oneself. Therefore, self-control is the base for a peace for the world! It is said that there is no more
          greater
          thing to the world than having one enlightened person.

          Quite a few NDE (near death experience) survivors testify that only Love is real. If so, then, what is the

          When we get lost, or stuck in life, is there any clue to getting out of it? Yes, there is. All we have to do
          is,
          no matter how trivial that is, to put everything you got in whatever you are doing right now. It could be
          something like toilet cleaning, changing diapers,or washing dishes. Without thinking anything, or with
          completely
          empty mind, do your very best at the present task. Something good happens.
