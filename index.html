      should be helpful. Here, I answer the most frequently asked questions
      about Oriental medicine. Then I introduce briefly the much broader
      subject of this medicine and its philosophy.

          What are acupuncture and moxibustion?
        </h6>
        <p class="card-text text-start">
          Acupuncture and moxibustion originated in China about 3000 years ago
          and has developed throughout various, mostly Asian, countries. It is
          based on the understanding that human beings are complex bioelectric
          systems. Energy circulates through our bodies along well-defined
          pathways. If this energy circulation is disrupted, body functions are
          affected and pain or illness results. The developers of acupuncture
          mapped out these body energy pathways called meridians. They also
          identified control points on the pathways at which harmful blockages
          can be corrected and health restored by means of acupuncture needles
          and moxibustion.

          What do acupuncture and moxibustion treatments feel like?

        <p class="card-text text-start">
          First, it&#39;s a relaxing experience. In fact, relaxation is a bonus
          benefit you get from acupuncture and moxibustion. Second, these
          treatments are usually painless operations. You may feel a slight
          pricking sensation, but most likely it won&#39;t be pain.

    <span class="fs-2">W</span>estern medicine may see your body as a fragile target under constant
    attack from outside invaders - germs, toxins and crazy cells. Your
    doctor fights back with drugs, surgery and radiation. While the method
    is necessary sometimes, often all you need is a little prevention.
    Oriental medicine contends that illness results not from outside
    invaders but from inside imbalances, which can be corrected peacefully
    and, to a great degree, by the patient him/herself. Disease is simply a
    warning that you have an imbalance that needs correcting.

    It is wrong to attach fear to disease because often fear can cause the
    disease itself. Try to think of it this way: Disease hasn&#39;t attacked you
    in some cruel random stroke. Rather, it&#39;s a helpful, if unpleasant,
    signal. It is telling you, in effect, that you&#39;ve let your natural body
    balance get out of whack, and you need to do something about it.
