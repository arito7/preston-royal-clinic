      Welcome to Preston Royal Clinic and to the practice of Oriental medicine

      If you are just getting acquainted with Oriental Medicine, this site
      should be helpful. Here, I answer the most frequently asked questions
      about Oriental medicine. Then I introduce briefly the much broader
      subject of this medicine and its philosophy.

      What are acupuncture and moxibustion?
    </h6>
    <p class="card-text text-start">
      Acupuncture and moxibustion originated in China about 3000 years ago
      and has developed throughout various, mostly Asian, countries. It is
      based on the understanding that human beings are complex bioelectric
      systems. Energy circulates through our bodies along well-defined
      pathways. If this energy circulation is disrupted, body functions are
      affected and pain or illness results. The developers of acupuncture
      mapped out these body energy pathways called meridians. They also
      identified control points on the pathways at which harmful blockages
      can be corrected and health restored by means of acupuncture needles
      and moxibustion.

      What do acupuncture and moxibustion treatments feel like?
    </h6>

    <p class="card-text text-start">
      First, it’s a relaxing experience. In fact, relaxation is a bonus
      benefit you get from acupuncture and moxibustion. Second, these
      treatments are usually painless operations. You may feel a slight
      pricking sensation, but most likely it won’t be pain.

      Can the effectiveness of Oriental medicine be enhanced or

      Yes, there are quite a few means by which you can intensify your own
      healing power.

      Kampo
    </h6>
    <p class="card-text">
      The majority of my patients use herbs to reinforce the healing
      effects of the treatments. These natural medicines have very
      specific healing properties. An herb called “Minor Blue Dragon,” for
      example, is good for allergies and sinusitis. Another herb called
      “Bupleurum and D.B.” is good for insomnia and depression. These
      medicines have helped, and continue to help people overcome illness
      for thousands of years. They are also free of the harmful side
      effects brought on by some conventional drugs.

      Diet

      With proper diet, you can speed up your healing and make it last
      longer. In fact, proper diet is indispensable if you expect to
      achieve complete healing. Occasional short term fasting, from one
      day to a week, is also recommended for cleansing.

      Chi exercise

      Chi exercise, such as Do-in and Qui-gong, are very useful to
      maintain and improve overall health by promoting the movement of Chi
      (vital energy). Our “Longevity Exercise” is one of them also and
      very recommendable.

      Meditation
    </h6>
    <p class="card-text">
      Mind over body is the name of the game. Though it is not the only
      way to control the mind, it is one of the most effective way to ease
      and balance the mind. Any kind of meditation is fine as long as you
      enjoy it.

    <span class="fs-2">W</span>estern medicine may see your body as a fragile target under constant
    attack from outside invaders – germs, toxins and crazy cells. Your
    doctor fights back with drugs, surgery and radiation. While the method
    is necessary sometimes, often all you need is a little prevention.
    Oriental medicine contends that illness results not from outside
    invaders but from inside imbalances, which can be corrected peacefully
    and, to a great degree, by the patient him/herself. Disease is simply a
    warning that you have an imbalance that needs correcting.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is wrong to attach fear to disease because often fear can cause the
    disease itself. Try to think of it this way: Disease hasn’t attacked you
    in some cruel random stroke. Rather, it’s a helpful, if unpleasant,
    signal. It is telling you, in effect, that you’ve let your natural body
    balance get out of whack, and you need to do something about it.
